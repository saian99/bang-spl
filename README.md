User Stories: users will be able to add new skate spots that they enjoyed or ones that they have not gone to yet. So that they can list them down and find the name, description, and address in a organized fashion. Once they add it they will be able to edit it and delete.

Troubles: Delete route is deleting my whole list and not just one. Images that the user trys to add in are not popping up in the show route.

Future Work: I want to add a login feature. I also want to add in google maps so that users can have an easier time finding and getting to the location of there spot. I aslo want to add more style but couldnt think of a layout and also ran out of time.
